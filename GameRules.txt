<html><p>"Goal: To be the first player to reach the top of three columns."</p><p>"Playing: To start your turn, roll all four dice. Look your roll over carefully. Then split your roll in half in any way you wish, and add the two dice in each half. The pair of numbers you choose to create represents the two columns into which you must now place game pieces." </p><p>In this game you may roll more than once on a single turn. On each additional roll, you also create a pair of numbers in the same way.</p><p>a) Let’s say you roll again and create a pair that includes a number you’ve already chosen. When this happens, move the game piece up one space in that number’s column.</p><p> b) Let’s say you roll again and decide to create a pair with a new number. If you have another game piece left, you must place it into the new game piece’s column.</p><p>You may continue to roll as long as your last roll allowed you either to place a game piece or to move one up. If you prefer, you may stop your turn whenever you wish. To stop, simply replace each temporary game piece with one of your final game pieces.</p> <p>a) If you choose a column that does not already have one of your colored pieces in it, place the game piece onto the space at the bottom of that column.</p><p>b) If you choose a column that does already have one of your colored game pieces in it, place the game piece onto the space directly above your colored square.</p><p>c) You may place a game piece onto a space that’s already occupied by an opponent’s piece.</p><p>d) If you can place a piece on your roll, you must.</p><p>Craping Out When your roll will not allow you either to place a game piece or to move one up, you’ve "blown it" and must end your turn. Remove all of the pieces that you’ve placed, but leave all of your colored squares that are already on the board.</p><br>Remember: As soon as you’ve placed all three pieces on your turn, each additional roll on that turn must allow you to move up at least one of the pieces. Otherwise you’ve "crapped out" and your turn ends.</br><p>Winning a Column. You win a column as soon as you place one of your game pieces onto the number at the top of that column. If any of your opponents already has a colored square in a column that you win, he or she must remove that square immediately.</p></html>
